This project contains the solutions for the Programming Assignments in Algorithms course offered by Coursera Taught by Robert Sedgewick.

To run the excercise code, [follow the instructions here](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/linux/) to set up developement environment.

* Percolation - [Specs](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/assignments/percolation.html) :
    * Run `java-coursera PercolationStats 100 100` to run monte carlo simulation on a 100 x 100 grid for 100 trials and calculat the percolation threshold.
    * Run `java-coursera PercolationVisualizer inputs/input8.txt` to visualize the percolation step by step using the given input file.
